# Kandula
this will be the basis of our opsschool Elephant site and used though out the course

this is a flask web app with structure put in place currently populated by mokups, later to be updated with real code by the students.
the students may use this as the bases for their "elephant" app, hanse the name.

why Kandula you ask?
well, Kandula was the Elephant Who Helped Unify Sri Lanka:
Kandula was the trusty companion of King Dutugamunu, the second-century B.C. ruler of Sri Lanka, who famously defeated King Elara, his South Indian rival, to become ruler of the entire island of Ceylon (today’s Sri Lanka). 
Captured in the forest around the time of Dutugamunu’s birth, the elephant Kandula grew up alongside the young prince. 
As the royal mount, he performed heroically in the siege of Vijitanagara (161 B.C.), returning to finish breaking down a fortified gate after recovering from having molten pitch poured on his back. According to the Mahavamsa, an ancient Buddhist chronicle, the king rushed to Kandula to administer a salve, exclaiming, “Dear Kandula, I’ll make you the lord of all Ceylon!” Later Kandula was Dutugamunu’s mount in his one-on-one combat when he defeated Elara (whose elephant’s name, Maha Pambata, means “big rock.”)
